                    <summary>Words from the Sorensen Family &amp; team</summary>
                    <p>"Thank you for your interest in our Couples Resort.  Here you will find the time to spend quality time together, and this is why we exist, to be here, so that you can spend lots of time together.  We, the Sorensen Family, started in 1967 to take care of guests, in 1989 we moved to couples only (no kids and no meetings/conferences) as we knew that many couples needed special time together.  In 2006, Canada Select which was rating 4000 accommodation properties in Canada, decided we should join them because we were easily in the top 1%, a 5 Star, and we are glad we made it for you to enjoy as you deserve it.  Now, many times of the year, we offer rates super discounted as we wish to be accessible to as many couples as possible, as all couples should benefit from quiet time together.  We have learned over the decades from our guests that those guests that have a love for gratitude for each other and for their surroundings are the happiest people, daily I ask how grateful am I, and I hope you are filled with many things that you are grateful for.  If you know other couples who need time away please pass on the word."</p>

                    <h4>GERTRUD SORNENSEN - ARTIST</h4>
                    <p>
                        Gertrud Sorensen is an Austrian-born Canadian. After a successful business career with Danish husband Fritz, at The Bear Trail Couples Resort, she became our resident artist. Gertrud presently operates an extensive art studio with over 30 paintings in her gallery. https://www.gertrudsorensen.com
                        <br><br>
                        The four Algonquin seasons are portrayed with varying moods in vibrant colours on her canvases. Having learned from Poul Thrane, David Armstrong, Gladys Ewing, Mary Lampman and Ron Leonard, it is easy to appreciate how they and the nature of Algonquin Park have influenced Gertrud's art.
                        <br><br>
                        Visit Gertrud's on-site studio while you are here and enjoy her artwork. Wander in and watch a canvas come to life. Take home a special gift to remember a romantic honeymoon or a joyous occasion as many of our guests from around the world have done.
