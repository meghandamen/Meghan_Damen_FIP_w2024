                <h4>GERTRUD SORNENSEN - ARTIST</h4>
                <p>
                    Gertrud Sorensen is an Austrian-born Canadian. After a successful business career with Danish husband Fritz, at The Bear Trail Couples Resort, she became our resident artist. Gertrud presently operates an extensive art studio with over 30 paintings in her gallery. https://www.gertrudsorensen.com
                    <br><br>
                    The four Algonquin seasons are portrayed with varying moods in vibrant colours on her canvases. Having learned from Poul Thrane, David Armstrong, Gladys Ewing, Mary Lampman and Ron Leonard, it is easy to appreciate how they and the nature of Algonquin Park have influenced Gertrud's art.
                    <br><br>
                    Visit Gertrud's on-site studio while you are here and enjoy her artwork. Wander in and watch a canvas come to life. Take home a special gift to remember a romantic honeymoon or a joyous occasion as many of our guests from around the world have done.
